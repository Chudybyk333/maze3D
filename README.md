# MAZE 3D - OpenGL Project

The goal of our project was to create a 3D maze game using OpenGL (3.3), GLFW, GLM, and STB in C++.

In our project, we implemented:

- **Maze Generation**: The maze can be generated with infinite variations
- **3D Objects**: Multiple models placed in a 3D space
- **Custom Textures**: Any texture can be assigned to objects
- **Advanced Lighting**: Phong Lighting model used in multiple light sources including point light and directional light
- **Texture Filtering**: Support for trilinear and bilinear filtering
- **Anti-Aliasing**: Multisampling (MSAA) for smooth textures and edges

**The maze can be generated with infinite variations of a loaded text file:**

The project was developed to explore real-time 3D graphics and modern rendering techniques for a final assignment for the **Computer Graphics** course at university.

Created by **Szymon Krzysztofik**, **Tadeusz Kogut**, and **Micha≈Ç Kuckowicz**.
